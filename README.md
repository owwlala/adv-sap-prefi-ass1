## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture

1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
	- Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a stage in the evolution of application development and/or integration. It defines a way to make software 	components reusable using the interfaces. Formally, SOA is an architectural approach in which applications make use of services available in the 	network.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
	- The first characteristic of SOA is that it have loose coupling meaning a client does not need or isn't required to understand the language that the 	service is using because it is independent and relies on a structured interface so that it can process the communication between the client and 	service. The second characteristic is it have interoperability meaning it can interact with variety of services since it is a necessity for large-	scale distributed networks. The third characteristic is it can be located easily since it is loosely coupled. Lastly, it is self-contained meaning it 	can operate by itself since it is independent.

3. Define Microservices.
	- Microservices are an architectural and organizational approach to software development where software is composed of small independent services that 	communicate over well-defined APIs.
    	Reference: https://aws.amazon.com/microservices/

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
	- The first benefit of using microservices is that it is scalable meaning it can make necessary changes without the need to disrupt an entire 	application. The second benefit is since microservices are independent, it can isolate the problem that crashed and the single crash won't disrupt the 	entire application. Lastly, it is flexible meaning they can be created by any programming language so that developers can find and use the best 	language for a certain application.

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
	- The differences between SOA and microservices is that the software size needed for SOA is larger since it is used by large-scale distributed 	networks while microservices, based on the word itself "micro", it uses smaller. Microservices are more fault tolerant since it have fault isolation 	while in SOA when one service slows down, it affects the entire application. The similarities between SOA and microservices is that it both provide 	support for web services. Their common goal is to have an easier software development.
